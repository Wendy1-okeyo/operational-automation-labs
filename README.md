Operational Automation Labs

This repository contains foundational PowerShell scripts developed as part of my transition from reactive system support toward proactive operational automation.

The focus is on:

System health validation

Automated service recovery

Log extraction for structured incident review

These scripts represent early automation experiments aimed at reducing repetitive manual operational tasks and improving reliability practices.
